## What does the mod add?
**Unknown Mod** adds two objects into the game:

-The **Unknown Block**

-The **Unknown Item**
## What do these objects do?
These objects do nothing but add a new block to build with, or can also be used as a currency. This mod is also my first project to figure out how to code a mod, so hopefully more can be added here soon and actually look nice without the objects to have boring textures.
## Support!
If you want, you can support my first mod by downloading it and give feedback to me about what you think I can add, or just an overall redo of the entire mod. Which, that will motivate me to create a better mod.

## What is integrated into this mod?
So far only: 
   * [TerraformersMC's Mod: Mod Menu](https://github.com/TerraformersMC/ModMenu) - Configurations when the mod is active
   * [Modrinth's Gradle Plugin: Minotaur](https://github.com/modrinth/minotaur) - Publishing purposes
