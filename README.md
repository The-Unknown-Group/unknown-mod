## What does the mod add?
**Unknown Mod** adds two objects into the game:

-The **Unknown Block**

-The **Unknown Item**
## What do these objects do?
These objects do nothing but add a new block to build with, or can also be used as a currency. This mod is also my first project to figure out how to code a mod, so hopefully more can be added here soon and actually look nice without the objects to have boring textures.
## What is integrated into this mod? - Credits & What I've used
So far only: 
   * [TerraformersMC's Mod: Mod Menu](https://github.com/TerraformersMC/ModMenu) - Configurations when their mod is active
   * [Modrinth's Gradle Plugin: Minotaur](https://github.com/modrinth/minotaur) - Publishing purposes
   * [Fabric](https://github.com/FabricMC) & [Fabric API](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric) - The mod is built on this
## Where else can I find this mod?
You can find this mod on [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/unknown-mod)! Soon, I'll be adding it to CurseForge, but as of right now, Modrinth is much better in terms of navigating and publishing the mod.
## Support!
If you want, you can support my first mod by downloading it and give feedback to me about what you think I can add, or just an overall redo of the entire mod. Which, that will motivate me to create a better mod. But, if you'd like to go above and beyond, click [here](https://github.com/sponsors/devonk15) and you'd become my sponsor. You can also click [here](https://www.patreon.com/theunknowngroup) and become a patron! In the end, I'd like to emphasize the fact that **you do not have to donate**, like I said before, just downloading means the world to me. Overall, I appreciate the fact that you did anything, including just taking the time to view this page. I give a huge and sincere **thank you** to the almost 60 and counting downloads.
